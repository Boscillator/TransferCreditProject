Environmental sociologists aim to understand the social origins of environmental problems and propose workable solutions to them. By showing how social interaction, institutions, and beliefs shape human behavior, environmental sociology provides a useful complement to the natural sciences in the analysis of the environmental problems faced today.Prerequisite: STSH 1110/STSS 1110 or permission of instructor.","min_credits":4,"max_credits":4,"active":true,"tags":["catalog"],"required_textbooks":[],"recommended_textbooks":[],"course_shortname":"2300","subject_shortname":"STSS"},"relationships":{"course":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/courses/894"},"data":{"type":"courses","id":"894"}},"term":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/terms/1"}},"sections":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/sections?filter[listing_id]=894"},"data":[{"type":"sections","id":"2115"}]}}},{"id":"895","type":"listings","attributes":{"uuid":"5ceef2fb-4b33-46f7-8be2-81ae90ecf3cf","longname":"Sociology","description":"A study of the principles and concepts of sociology and their application to the study of society and self.

This course will explore the law's social, political, cultural, and historical aspects.

Students will be exposed to the theoretical frameworks that are used to examine how the law shapes society, and society shapes the law, and develop an understanding of the social processes that affect the legal system. The course will advance students' capacity to think critically and communicate effectively about themes, concepts, and arguments surrounding the law and learn what law is; where it comes from; who creates it; and what roles it plays in shaping society. ","min_credits":4,"max_credits":4,"active":true,"tags":["catalog"],"required_textbooks":[],"recommended_textbooks":[],"course_shortname":"2700","subject_shortname":"STSS"},"relationships":{"course":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/courses/896"},"data":{"type":"courses","id":"896"}},"term":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/terms/1"}},"sections":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/sections?filter[listing_id]=896"},"data":[{"type":"sections","id":"2117"}]}}},{"id":"897","type":"listings","attributes":{"uuid":"0bd367ef-6e5d-4c6a-929a-88a7c4f5f57f","longname":"Readings in Science and Technology Studies, Anthropology/Archaeology, History, Political Science, or Sociology","description":"With an individual faculty member on an agreed-upon topic.","min_credits":1,"max_credits":6,"active":true,"tags":["catalog"],"required_textbooks":[],"recommended_textbooks":[],"course_shortname":"2940","subject_shortname":"STSS"},"relationships":{"course":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/courses/897"},"data":{"type":"courses","id":"897"}},"term":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/terms/1"}},"sections":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/sections?filter[listing_id]=897"},"data":[{"type":"sections","id":"2118"}]}}},{"id":"952","type":"listings","attributes":{"uuid":"a8d19163-24fb-4f98-986a-534b580cc6c1","longname":"Pd2 Tech Issues \u0026 Solutions","description":null,"min_credits":2,"max_credits":2,"active":true,"tags":[],"required_textbooks":[],"recommended_textbooks":[],"course_shortname":"4100","subject_shortname":"STSS"},"relationships":{"course":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/courses/952"},"data":{"type":"courses","id":"952"}},"term":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/terms/1"}},"sections":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/sections?filter[listing_id]=952"},"data":[{"type":"sections","id":"2211"},{"type":"sections","id":"2212"},{"type":"sections","id":"2213"},{"type":"sections","id":"2214"},{"type":"sections","id":"2215"},{"type":"sections","id":"2216"},{"type":"sections","id":"2217"},{"type":"sections","id":"2218"},{"type":"sections","id":"2219"},{"type":"sections","id":"2220"},{"type":"sections","id":"2221"},{"type":"sections","id":"2222"},{"type":"sections","id":"2223"},{"type":"sections","id":"2224"},{"type":"sections","id":"2225"}]}}},{"id":"898","type":"listings","attributes":{"uuid":"15daf89d-ce76-4c0a-86b4-1057f2f832a1","longname":"Bioethics","description":null,"min_credits":4,"max_credits":4,"active":true,"tags":[],"required_textbooks":[],"recommended_textbooks":[],"course_shortname":"4250","subject_shortname":"STSS"},"relationships":{"course":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/courses/898"},"data":{"type":"courses","id":"898"}},"term":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/terms/1"}},"sections":{"links":{"related":"https://localhost/api/v6/sections?filter[listing_id]=898"},"data":[{"type":"sections","id":"2119"}]}}},{"id":"899","type":"listings","attributes":{"uuid":"f28c76e4-49e2-4e58-a4e1-75d5cb4345b1","longname":"Sustainability Education","description":"This course examines needs for and challenges of delivering environmental education in different settings.
