Effectively advocating for one point of view requires an understanding of other perspectives. One must approach every issue with an open mind and a willingness to engage on a legal and policy level rather than from a personal or political perspective. This objective detachment is one of the hardest and most crucial skills students will work to learn. Over the course of the semester, the class will feature guest speakers (dates and identities TBA).
